# SpellingCee

A clone of the [NYT Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee)
game with some additional features (eventually).

## Game IDs

Games are identified by IDs. A game ID is a string of 7 lowercase alphabetic characters, where the first character is the “center” letter, and the other 6 letters are in alphabetical order, e.g. `icerotu`.

## Games

Every player will be presented with the same initial game on a given day. Players may start a new game at any point. When a player opens SpellingCee on a given machine, they will be presented with the most recently active game. Players can access past games via a dropdown.
